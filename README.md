# stlcat
A simple, small, terminal based, stl viwer written in C

## About
***This is a personal project so don't expect much***
(Though I would love to hear some criticism <3)

Lets you render and view an stl file in your terminal. Currently only supports binary stl format and only renders the points of a mesh. Requires ANSI and 256 color support (which your terminal probably has), tested with kitty.

## Usage
`stlcat <fov> <path/to/file.stl>`

## Building
Just build using `cmake` and any compiler with C17+ support, tested with `clang 20.1.7`.

## Contributing
Any contributions/issues/etc. are highly appreciated <3
